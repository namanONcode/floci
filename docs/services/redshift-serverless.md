# Redshift Serverless

**Protocol:** JSON 1.1
**Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:4566/` with `X-Amz-Target: RedshiftServerless.<Operation>` and `Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.1`

Floci emulates the namespace and workgroup lifecycle of Amazon Redshift Serverless: the account and Region scoped namespace that holds a serverless database, its admin credentials, and its IAM roles, and the workgroup that carries its compute settings and endpoint. This is the surface Terraform's `aws_redshiftserverless_namespace` and `aws_redshiftserverless_workgroup` drive, and the surface the `AWS::RedshiftServerless::Namespace` and `AWS::RedshiftServerless::Workgroup` CloudFormation types provision.

For the upstream API shape, see the [Amazon Redshift Serverless API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift-serverless/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html).

<!-- floci:actions:end -->

Namespace and workgroup state is account and Region scoped and persisted through `StorageFactory`.

## Compatibility Notes

- **A workgroup runs a real PostgreSQL container.** `CreateWorkgroup` starts the container (this needs Docker and uses `floci.services.redshift.image-version`) and an authenticating proxy on the `endpoint`, whose port comes from the same pool as provisioned Redshift clusters (`floci.services.redshift.proxy-base-port` to `proxy-max-port`). Connect with any PostgreSQL client or JDBC driver using the namespace admin user and password, to the namespace `dbName`. The Redshift Data API accepts `WorkgroupName` ([details](redshift-data.md)). Only the 14 operations in the Supported Actions table are served. The rest of the Redshift Serverless API is not emulated and answers `UnknownOperationException`: snapshots and snapshot copy configurations, recovery points, table restore and restore status, usage limits, endpoint access, resource policies, custom domain associations, scheduled actions, reservations and reservation offerings, tracks, managed workgroups, the Identity Center token, and lakehouse configuration.
- **Admin credentials come from the namespace.** The backend role is the namespace `adminUsername` (default `admin`) and the password is the `adminUserPassword` the namespace was created with. A namespace created without a password gets a generated one that is kept internally and never returned, so such a workgroup is reachable through `GetCredentials` and the Data API only. `manageAdminPassword` still creates no secret. Changing `adminUserPassword` with `UpdateNamespace` takes effect for new connections and is refused with `ValidationException` if the backend rejects it (AWS password rules: 8 to 64 characters with upper case, lower case and a digit, and none of `' "  / @`). Changing `adminUsername` on a running workgroup does not rename the backend role; the new name is accepted at the proxy, which opens the backend as the original role.
- **`GetCredentials` returns a master-equivalent password.** `dbUser` is derived from the signing identity (`IAM:<user>` or `IAMR:<role>`, falling back to `IAMR:floci` when the caller cannot be resolved), `dbPassword` is random, and `expiration` and `nextRefreshTime` are epoch seconds (the same instant). `durationSeconds` defaults to 900 and must be 900 to 3600. `dbName`, when given, must be the namespace `dbName`. `customDomainName` is not supported. A returned credential stays valid until it expires or the workgroup is deleted.
- **The runtime survives a restart when its container does.** On startup Floci re-attaches to the container and restarts the proxy on the same port, so the endpoint is stable. If the container is gone the workgroup comes back with an empty database; if neither can be started, the workgroup stays `AVAILABLE`, the Data API reports that its runtime is not available, and the failure is logged. Containers have no Docker volume, as for provisioned clusters.
- **`adminUserPassword` is accepted and never returned**, matching AWS. No secret is created for `manageAdminPassword`.
- **Defaults follow AWS.** `dbName` defaults to `dev`, `kmsKeyId` to `AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY`, `logExports` to an empty list, and `status` to `AVAILABLE` immediately: there is no `MODIFYING` or `CREATING` phase to poll through.
- **`creationDate` is an ISO-8601 string**, for example `2026-09-11T18:12:55.433Z`, not the
  epoch-seconds number that awsJson1.1 uses by default. `Namespace.creationDate` carries
  `TimestampFormatTrait(ISO_8601)` in the API model, and strict SDKs reject a number here even
  though the AWS CLI accepts one. (Not a model-wide rule: roughly half the model's timestamp
  members carry no format trait and use the epoch default, so check each member when extending
  this service.)
- **`namespaceId` is a generated UUID** and `namespaceArn` is `arn:aws:redshift-serverless:<region>:<account>:namespace/<namespaceId>`.
- **`DeleteNamespace` returns the deleted namespace with `status` `DELETING`** and removes it in the same call, so the next `GetNamespace` returns `ResourceNotFoundException`.
- **`UpdateNamespace` applies only the fields present in the request.** An omitted field keeps its stored value; an explicitly empty `iamRoles` or `logExports` array clears it.
- **A namespace has at most one workgroup, and a workgroup belongs to exactly one namespace.** A second `CreateWorkgroup` for a namespace returns `ConflictException`, and so does `DeleteNamespace` while the namespace still has a workgroup. AWS documents the one-to-one relationship; the `DeleteNamespace` refusal is the one rule here that is inferred rather than documented, because the API reference lists `ConflictException` for that call without naming its trigger.
- **Workgroup defaults follow AWS.** `baseCapacity` defaults to 128 RPUs, `port` to 5439, `ipAddressType` to `ipv4`, `trackName` to `current`, `pricePerformanceTarget` to `{"status":"DISABLED"}`, and `enhancedVpcRouting`, `publiclyAccessible` and `extraComputeForAutomaticOptimization` to `false`. `status` is `AVAILABLE` as soon as the call returns; `DeleteWorkgroup` returns the workgroup with `DELETING` and removes it in the same call.
- **Capacity, network and security settings are stored and echoed, not enforced.** `baseCapacity`, `maxCapacity`, `subnetIds`, `securityGroupIds`, `enhancedVpcRouting`, `publiclyAccessible` and `configParameters` have no effect on the emulator. `configParameters` returns only what the caller supplied: AWS also adds a set of default parameters that the API reference does not enumerate, and Terraform treats the attribute as computed, so the difference does not produce a plan diff.
- **`port` is validated and echoed.** It must be in 5431-5455 or 8191-8215. The `endpoint.port` is the port Floci allocated, which is what a client connects to.
- **`UpdateWorkgroup` applies only the fields present.** AWS documents that several parameters cannot be changed in one request; Floci accepts any combination. A `trackName` different from the current one is recorded as `pendingTrackName` and `trackName` is unchanged, as AWS switches tracks on the next release. `workgroupName` and `namespaceName` cannot be changed.
- **`workgroupArn` is `arn:aws:redshift-serverless:<region>:<account>:workgroup/<workgroupId>`**, and `creationDate` is an ISO-8601 string like the namespace one. `workgroupVersion`, `patchVersion`, `crossAccountVpcs`, the custom domain members and `endpoint.vpcEndpoints` are omitted.
- **Tagging is keyed by `resourceArn`, not by name**, and namespaces and workgroups are the taggable Redshift Serverless resources in Floci. `TagResource` merges into the existing tags rather than replacing them, `UntagResource` removes by key, and any ARN that does not name a known namespace or workgroup in the caller's Region returns `ResourceNotFoundException`. Tags supplied at create are readable through `ListTagsForResource` and survive an update.

## AWS-compatible failures

Namespace and workgroup names, database names, log export values, ports and workgroup enum members are validated. Floci returns `ValidationException` for a malformed request, `ConflictException` when a namespace or workgroup name is already taken, when a namespace already has a workgroup, or when a namespace being deleted still has one, and `ResourceNotFoundException` for an unknown namespace or workgroup.

AWS also models `AccessDeniedException`, `InternalServerException`, and `ThrottlingException`. Floci does not inject provider-side failures that cannot be derived from the request or emulator state.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_REDSHIFT_SERVERLESS_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable or disable Redshift Serverless |

Workgroup containers and proxies use the `floci.services.redshift.*` settings: `image-version`, `proxy-base-port` and `proxy-max-port`, `endpoint-host`, `docker-network` and the proxy connection limits.
