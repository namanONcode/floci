# CodePipeline

Floci implements the AWS CodePipeline JSON 1.1 API and a local pipeline execution engine.

**Protocol:** `POST /` with `Content-Type: application/x-amz-json-1.1` and
`X-Amz-Target: CodePipeline_20150709.<Action>`.

## Supported Operations (44 total)

The complete CodePipeline 2015-07-09 API surface is routed:

- Pipeline lifecycle, state, execution history, start, stop, retry, and rollback
- Stage transitions, manual approvals, action and rule execution history
- Custom action types and AWS/third-party worker job polling
- Webhook registration and tag lifecycle

Pipeline definitions, executions, custom action types, jobs, webhooks, tags, and transition
state use Floci's configured storage backend.

## Execution

Stages execute in declaration order. Actions with the same `runOrder` execute in parallel.
`SUPERSEDED`, `QUEUED`, and `PARALLEL` execution modes are recognized, with `QUEUED` and
`PARALLEL` restricted to V2 pipelines.
A `QUEUED` or `PARALLEL` pipeline holds at most 50 active executions, as on AWS;
`StartPipelineExecution` beyond that returns `ConcurrentPipelineExecutionsLimitExceededException`.

S3 source actions poll for source changes by default, matching AWS when `PollForSourceChanges` is
omitted or set to `true`. Floci establishes a baseline for the configured object and starts one new
execution when its version ID or ETag changes, recording `PollForSourceChanges` as the execution
trigger. Set `PollForSourceChanges` to `false` to disable this polling path.

`RetryStageExecution` resumes the same pipeline execution at a failed stage. `FAILED_ACTIONS`
reruns failed or not-yet-started actions while preserving successful actions; `ALL_ACTIONS` reruns
the complete stage. Runtime artifacts from failed executions are retained for the retry until a newer
execution fails the same stage, and a successful retry continues with the stages that follow rather
than restarting from the source.
A retried execution counts toward the `QUEUED`/`PARALLEL` active-execution limit, and a second retry of
the same execution while it is still running, including while sibling actions of a failed action
finish, returns `ConflictException`.

S3 source actions resolve `sourceRevisions` from the object actually consumed by the execution.
Unversioned objects report their ETag as the revision ID; versioned objects report the version ID.
`StartPipelineExecution.sourceRevisions` is treated as an override, including supported S3 object-key
and version-ID overrides, rather than being copied directly into execution history.
Resolved revisions appear in `ListPipelineExecutions` summaries, as on AWS. `RollbackStage` reruns
with the object key and version ID the target execution consumed, so rolling back redeploys that
version rather than the latest upload.

The following providers execute against local Floci services:

| Category | Provider | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Source | S3 | Reads the configured object and publishes the output artifact |
| Source | GitHub (ThirdParty, v1) | Downloads the configured branch archive from github.com and publishes it with the repo contents at the artifact root |
| Build/Test | CodeBuild | Starts and monitors the configured local CodeBuild project |
| Deploy | S3 | Writes the input artifact to the configured bucket and key |
| Deploy | CodeDeploy | Starts and monitors a local CodeDeploy deployment |
| Invoke | Lambda | Invokes the configured local Lambda function |
| Invoke | CodePipeline | Starts a nested local pipeline execution |
| Approval | Manual | Waits for `PutApprovalResult` |
| Custom/third-party | Any registered action | Uses poll, acknowledge, success, and failure job APIs |

AWS-managed providers without a corresponding Floci execution adapter fail the action with an
AWS-shaped action error. Floci does not call real AWS accounts or third-party SaaS providers.

## Approvals

`PutApprovalResult` completes waiting Manual approval actions with AWS-shaped validation
and error responses. Floci validates the stage and action names, enforces `result.status`
as `Approved` or `Rejected`, limits `result.summary` to 512 characters, returns
`InvalidApprovalTokenException` for unknown tokens, and returns
`ApprovalAlreadyCompletedException` if the same approval token is reused after completion.

## V2 stage conditions

V2 stage condition blocks (`beforeEntry` and `onSuccess`) are evaluated during execution. Two rule providers evaluate for real: **LambdaInvoke** (invokes the configured local Lambda function; the rule passes when the invocation succeeds) and **VariableCheck** (compares a `#{variables.name}` reference with `EQ`, `NE`, `CONTAINS`, or `MATCHES`; `MATCHES` rejects a pattern or value longer than 256 characters). `Commands`, `DeploymentWindow` and `CloudWatchAlarm` rules are accepted but pass permissively. A `VariableCheck` reference resolves against the start request's variables and the pipeline's declared defaults; a reference that cannot be resolved (including action output variables) fails the rule. Every rule run is recorded on the execution and returned by `ListRuleExecutions`; `ListRuleTypes` returns the AWS rule catalog.

A failed `beforeEntry` or `onSuccess` condition applies its declared `result`: `FAIL` (the default) stops the execution, and `SKIP` skips the stage when it is on a `beforeEntry` condition. A failed `onSuccess` condition always fails the stage, because the stage has already run. `OverrideStageCondition` marks the condition overridden and, when the execution failed on exactly that condition, resumes it from the overridden stage. `onFailure` conditions and the `ROLLBACK` result are not acted on; a stage failure is recorded as a plain failure.

## Events and notifications

Executions publish the real `aws.codepipeline` state-change events to the **default
EventBridge bus**: `CodePipeline Pipeline Execution State Change` (STARTED, SUCCEEDED,
FAILED, STOPPING, STOPPED, RESUMED), `CodePipeline Stage Execution State Change`, and
`CodePipeline Action Execution State Change`, with the pipeline ARN in `resources` and
the documented detail fields. EventBridge rules matching `{"source":
["aws.codepipeline"]}` deliver them to any configured target. Publishing is best-effort
and never fails the execution.

A Manual approval action whose configuration sets `NotificationArn` publishes the
approval-needed message (subject `APPROVAL NEEDED: AWS CodePipeline ...`, JSON body with
the approval token, `expires` as an ISO-8601 timestamp, `consoleLink`, `approvalReviewLink`,
`CustomData` and `ExternalEntityLink`) to that SNS topic when it starts waiting. The subject is truncated to SNS's 100-character limit.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_CODEPIPELINE_ENABLED` | `true` | Enables the CodePipeline API |
| `FLOCI_STORAGE_SERVICES_CODEPIPELINE_MODE` | global mode | Overrides CodePipeline storage mode |
| `FLOCI_STORAGE_SERVICES_CODEPIPELINE_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS` | `5000` | Hybrid storage flush interval |
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_CODEPIPELINE_SOURCE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `500` | How often (ms) S3 sources are polled for a new object revision |
