# Resource Groups Tagging API

**Protocol:** JSON 1.1
**Header:** `X-Amz-Target: ResourceGroupsTaggingAPI_20170126.<Action>`
**Endpoint prefix:** `tagging`

Floci emulates the AWS Resource Groups Tagging API for local tests that need
centralized tag discovery across AWS-shaped ARNs. `GetResources`, `GetTagKeys`
and `GetTagValues` list both the tags written through this API and the tags
each resource's own service holds, so a queue created with `CreateQueue` tags
is found without a separate `TagResources` call. Any other ARN is accepted as
well, and its tags are kept in the tagging store.

## Supported Operations

| Operation | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| `TagResources` | Adds or updates tags for one or more resource ARNs |
| `UntagResources` | Removes tag keys from one or more resource ARNs |
| `GetResources` | Lists tagged resources, with ARN, tag, resource type, and pagination filters |
| `GetTagKeys` | Lists distinct tag keys for the current region |
| `GetTagValues` | Lists distinct values for a requested tag key in the current region |

`TagResources` and `UntagResources` return an empty `FailedResourcesMap` on
success. An ARN the owning service rejected is listed there with that
service's own `StatusCode`, `ErrorCode` and `ErrorMessage`, such as
`400 BadRequestException` for a reserved `floci:` key on an API key, and the
call still returns HTTP 200. An ARN that names a region other than the
request's fails the whole call with HTTP 400 `InvalidParameterException`,
`Region in the ARN <arn> does not match with the region in which TagResources
API is invoked` (or `UntagResources`), and nothing is tagged or untagged.
`GetResources`, `GetTagKeys`, and `GetTagValues` support pagination tokens for
multi-page responses; a token past the last result returns an empty page.

## Resource discovery

Reads merge two sources for the request's region and account:

- The owning service's tags, for every service that
  [Resource Explorer 2 indexes](resource-explorer.md#discoverable-services),
  including SQS, Lambda, CloudWatch Logs, S3 and API Gateway (REST APIs,
  stages, API keys, usage plans and custom domain names). Only resources that
  carry at least one tag are listed.
- The tagging store, which holds tags written through `TagResources` that were
  not forwarded to an owning service, and the copies EventBridge and Glue keep
  there.

When both hold the same ARN, the result is one mapping, and for the same key
the owning service's value wins. CloudWatch Logs log group ARNs are returned
without the trailing `:*`.

`TagResources` forwards the tags to the owning service only when that service
registers a tag handler, such as API Gateway, MSK, SQS, Lambda or CloudWatch
Logs, and currently lists the exact ARN as one of its resources visible to the
request's region and account, by the same rule reads use. The tags then live
only in the owning service, so `GetApiKey`, `ListQueueTags`, Lambda `ListTags`
and CloudWatch Logs `ListTagsForResource` show a tag set through
`TagResources`, and nothing is written to the tagging store. When the owning
service rejects the tags, for example a reserved `floci:` key on an API key or
a log group ARN with the trailing `:*`, the ARN appears in `FailedResourcesMap`
with that service's error and no tags are stored for it. A log group ARN with
the trailing `:*` is rejected this way whether or not the group exists, as in
AWS, and so is any other ARN ending in `:*` whose service registers a tag
handler, such as an SQS queue ARN. Every other ARN, including
one the owning service does not list such as an API Gateway deployment ARN,
goes to the tagging store and the owning service is not called.
`UntagResources` routes the same way, and also removes the keys from the
tagging store for every ARN, including one the owning service rejects but not
one reported as unresolved or from another account, so a copy stored earlier
can always be cleared. When the service owning an ARN cannot be read while
routing and no service lists the ARN, it is reported in `FailedResourcesMap`
with `InternalServiceException` (status 500) and left unchanged, while ARNs a
service lists, and ARNs of services that were read, still go through. An ARN
from another account is reported in `FailedResourcesMap` with
`AccessDeniedException` (status 403) and nothing is tagged; AWS also reports
it per ARN, but with the owning service's own error, such as `InvalidAddress`
for SQS or `ValidationException` for CloudWatch Logs.

## Filtering

`GetResources` supports the common Resource Groups Tagging filters:

| Filter | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `ResourceARNList` | Restricts results to the requested ARNs |
| `TagFilters` | Matches resources that have each requested key; values are optional |
| `ResourceTypeFilters` | Matches `service` or `service:resourceType`, such as `lambda`, `lambda:function` or `ec2:instance` |
| `ResourcesPerPage` + `PaginationToken` | Pages through matching resource mappings |

The resource type in `service:resourceType` matches the ARN's type, which is
the ARN resource part with one leading `/` dropped, cut at the first `/` or
`:`, or the type the owning service declares for the resource. So
`lambda:function`, `logs:log-group`, `ec2:instance`, `apigateway:apikeys` and
`apigateway:restapis/stages` all match. SQS queue ARNs have no type segment, so
`sqs:queue` matches through the type SQS declares for its queues. As in AWS,
`apigateway:restapis` lists REST APIs together with their stages, and a filter
type with a leading `/`, such as `apigateway:/apikeys`, matches nothing.

A resource is visible in the region its ARN names. When the ARN has no region,
such as an S3 bucket ARN, the owning service's region for the resource
decides, also for tags the tagging store holds for that ARN, so an
`eu-west-1` bucket tagged through `TagResources` is not listed from
`us-east-1`. A region-less ARN known only to the tagging store is visible in
every region. As in AWS, a resource the owning service reports without a
region, or in the region `global` as IAM does for users and roles, is never
listed, and `TagResources` does not forward to its owning service; an IAM ARN
is never listed at all, even one only the tagging store holds, for example
after the role is deleted. Every store is per account, so results are scoped
to the calling account. An ARN with an empty account segment, such as an API
Gateway ARN, only leaves the account out of the ARN; the resource is still
listed for the account that owns it.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLOCI_SERVICES_TAGGING_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable or disable the Resource Groups Tagging API service |
| `FLOCI_STORAGE_SERVICES_TAGGING_MODE` | _(global storage mode)_ | Override the storage mode for the tagging store |
| `FLOCI_STORAGE_SERVICES_TAGGING_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS` | `5000` | Flush interval for the tagging store in `hybrid` mode |

## Examples

```python
import boto3

tagging = boto3.client(
    "resourcegroupstaggingapi",
    endpoint_url="http://localhost:4566",
    region_name="us-east-1",
)

arn = "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:000000000000:function:my-func"

tagging.tag_resources(
    ResourceARNList=[arn],
    Tags={"Environment": "dev", "Team": "platform"},
)

resources = tagging.get_resources(
    TagFilters=[{"Key": "Environment", "Values": ["dev"]}],
)
print(resources["ResourceTagMappingList"])
```

## Out of Scope

- Validation that a `TagResources` ARN names an existing resource: an ARN that
  no emulated service lists is accepted and kept in the tagging store.
- AWS Organizations tag policy enforcement.
